Squid-Guard version 0.09
============================

Squid::Guard is a module for creating a simple yet flexible
redirector for the Squid web cache engine.
It was inspired by squidGuard, a popular squid redirector written
in C, but aims to be more flexible and in some ways simpler
to use.
I was happy with squidGuard and used it for years. But I needed
certain extra features like the ability to differentiate
between users based on some external program output, group
belongings etc.
squidGuard did not support this, so Squid::Guard was born.

The module has built-in support for some common tasks performed in
Squid redirectors, including:
- lookup of domain or url in .db files created from text files,
like squidGuard does. Expression files are also supported.
Contrary to squidGuard, here the regexps are Perl regexps ;)
- lookup of user in UNIX or winbind (SaMBa, Windows) groups

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

USAGE

See the examples for inspiration.

The fundamental part is defining a callback function, which has to
be registered to the module via the checkf method.
This function will be called for every request that is performed to
the redirector. Here you decide what to do with it.

If you're looking for a redirector, them it's likely that you want
to use some list of sites or urls to deny or accept your client'
requests. This is accomplished in a way similar to squidGuard.

First collect the domains, urls and/or expressions plaintext files.
You can use your own, or download some publicly available list like
http://www.shallalist.de/ (thank you Shalla).
Organize your files in categories which correspond to some
directory on your disk. For example, say you want two categories,
named whitelist and blacklist. Each category contains some domains
or urls which you want to always accept/deny respectively.
you can create the directories /var/lib/guard/whitelist and
/var/lib/guard/blacklist , put your domains, urls and/or
expressions files there.
Then you have to register your two categories in your module via
the addcateg method. This will create or update the .db files if
needed (like in squidGuard, .db are created only for domains and
urls files).
Now in your callback function you can use the checkincateg method
to check if a request comes in a certain category, and decide what
to do with it.
